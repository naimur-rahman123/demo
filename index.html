    <h1>Hello Travellers</h1>
    <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Jodi. Welcome to Legal Nomads.</h2>

    <p>
      In 2008, I quit my job as a lawyer to visit Siberia. I started Legal
      Nomads to share photos and stories from my travels with friends and
      family. I planned to take only a year sabbatical to travel the world. I
      never returned to the law. Instead, this site became the backbone of a new
      career. As its audience grew, so did my appetite. Food was the best way I
      could connect to others in a new place. As a celiac, learning about food
      helped me navigate with less anxiety and chance of illness. In 2017, a
      botched spinal tap derailed my life and left me disabled. My work and
      travels ground to a halt. Legal Nomads became a lifeline, with my readers
      supporting me during these big changes. The site now reflects my new
      reality: not only do I share lessons from the road, but also how to cope
      with grief and chronic pain. And how to cultivate the resilience required
      to navigate tough times. Through it all, Legal Nomads remains a place to
      connect with others through curiosity and discovery. I hope you enjoy it!
